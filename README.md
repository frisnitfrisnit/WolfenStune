# WolfenStune

Followed the free "Raycasting Basics with JavaScript" tutorial from Pikuma (https://courses.pikuma.com/courses/raycasting), but used Raylib (https://www.raylib.com/) and C++ instead.

It's a basic 2D raycaster made using the same techniques that Wolfenstein used, as that's what I was interested in, rather than how it could be made better using more modern raycasting techniques. Made a couple of tweaks but generally stayed faithful to the tutorial material and removed my experimental code.

Worth giving it a go if you're interested in Wolfenstein, raycasting or gaming/coding history!
